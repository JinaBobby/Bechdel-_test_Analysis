**The Bechdel test** analysis is originally introduced in 1985 through a comic strip by Alison Bechdel, the test asks whether a movie:

 * Features at least two named women,
 * Who speak to each other,
 * About something other than a man

The Bechdel Test is treated not as a scorecard for “good” or “bad” movies,
Passing the Bechdel Test does not automatically mean a movie has strong female representation, and failing it does not mean the film lacks quality.
However, when a movie fails, it often reveals deeper narrative gaps, such as:
 * Female characters existing but never interacting
 * Women appearing only in relation to male characters

**What This Project Explores**

 * How many movies pass vs fail the Bechdel Test overall
 * How Bechdel pass rates have changed over time
 * The most common reasons movies fail (and what that says about storytelling choices)
 * Whether common industry beliefs hold up under data, such as:
  “Female-driven movies don’t sell”
  “Representation hurts profitability”
  “Inclusive films are niche
  
One of the most interesting discoveries from this analysis is that more than half of the movies released between **1970 and 2013 actually pass the Bechdel Test**.
The percentage of movies passing the Bechdel Test has **steadily increased over time**, with noticeable improvement beginning in the late 20th century and continuing into the 2000s.
passing the Bechdel Test does not guarantee strong or progressive representation—many films pass by meeting the criteria in minimal or incidental ways.
